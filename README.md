# Congestion Reduction via Personalized Incentives
With rapid population growth and urban development, traffic congestion has become an inescapable issue, especially in large cities. Many congestion reduction strategies have been proposed in the past, ranging from roadway extension to transportation demand management programs. In particular, congestion pricing schemes have been used as negative reinforcements for traffic control. In this project, we study an alternative approach of offering positive incentives to drivers to take alternative routes. More specifically, we propose an algorithm to reduce traffic congestion and improve routing efficiency via offering personalized incentives to drivers.  We exploit the wide-accessibility of smart communication devices to communicate with drivers and develop a look-ahead incentive offering mechanism using individualsâ€™ routing and aggregate traffic information. The incentives are offered after solving a large-scale optimization problem in order to minimize the total travel time (or minimize any utility of the network such as total Carbon emission). Since this massive size optimization problem needs to be solved continually in the network, we developed a distributed computational approach where a major computational burden is carried out on the individual drivers' smart phones (and in parallel among drivers). We  theoretically show the convergence of the proposed distributed algorithm under a mild set of assumptions that are verified with real data.
# Synthetic data
Due to not being able to share our data with public, we ran createSyntheticData.py to generate synthetic data so you can follow the next steps to run the codes.

# Optimization model
### Requirements
- Python 3.6.8
- PyTorch 1.1.0
- Numpy 1.19.4+mkl
- Scipy 0.19.1
- NetworkX 1.11
- pickle
- joblib 0.14.0
- pandas 1.1.4
- PyYAML 5.1.2
- Matplotlib 2.2.3
- gurobipy 9.0.2
- psutil 5.7.2

## Learning graph of the network
First, define the desired setting on the file "optimization/YAML_graph/region_z.yaml".
Go to the 'optimization' folder. Run the following command:
```bash
python All_in_one.py --config_filename=YAML_graph/region_z.yaml
```

## Learning parameters of the BPR function
First, define the desired setting on the file "optimization/YAML_BPR/region_z.yaml".
Go to the 'optimization' folder. Run the following command to learn the parameters of the BPR function:
```bash
python link_capacity.py --config_filename=YAML_BPR/region_z.yaml
```
The extracted information for region z is provided in: 'optimizaiton/data/capcacity/region_z'

## Learning free flow travel time of routes
First, define the desired setting on the file "optimization/YAML_BPR/region_z.yaml".
Go to the 'optimization' folder. Run the following command:
```bash
python tt_BPR.py --config_filename=YAML_BPR/region_z.yaml
```


## Linear model (no incentive or baseline)
To solve these linear optimization model, first you should Follow the steps of OD estimation section to retrieve all matrices P, R, and Q. Next, you should copy and paste the latest created files from the following folders to the folders with same name in "optimization/DPFE_files":
1. observe_index_N
2. P_matrix
3. P_matrix_opt
4. Q_vector
5. R_matrix
6. tt
7. X_vector
Then, you need to specify the name of the generated folders in these 7 folders in YAML/region_z.yaml file as new_file:2021_03_28_03_35_11 (2021_03_28_03_35_11 is the name of my folder)
